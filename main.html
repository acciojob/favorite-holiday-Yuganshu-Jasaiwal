	<h1>Kashmir</h1>
	<br>
	<p>Kashmir is a region in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, covering around 86,000 sq 
		miles (222,200 sq km), and known for its lakes, meadows and mountains123. It is bounded 
		by China, India, Pakistan, and Afghanistan23. It was a princely state that was free to 
		join either India or Pakistan after the British partition in 194714. However, both India 
		and Pakistan claimed the whole region, leading to a territorial conflict that resulted 
		in three wars and several skirmishes</p>
